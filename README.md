# Text-Classification-word2vec-using-Machine-learning-
This project demonstrates text classification using the IMDB dataset and Word2Vec embeddings. The aim is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

Introduction
This project showcases the use of Word2Vec embeddings in conjunction with machine learning algorithms for text classification. The IMDB dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, is used to train and evaluate the model.

Dataset
The IMDB dataset is a popular dataset for binary sentiment classification. It contains 50,000 movie reviews, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
